# Project Name:  Global Energy Trade Analysis

## Problem Statement:
One of the most unique power bi projects ideas is the Global Energy Trade
Analysis. This project concept includes various topics concerning global energy
exchange and production. It addresses several topics, such as the expansion of
wind energy, energy consumption as a different basis for comparing national
economies, etc.

The resulting dashboard could display total energy statistics on production,
commodity exchange, and usage of primary and secondary energy,
conventional and non-conventional energy sources, and new and renewable
energy sources. For the dashboard, you can use **Power BI visualization** types
such as Bar Charts, Flow Maps, Cards for the overview page, Ribbon Charts,
Treemaps, Bar Charts for the energy production and exchange pages, etc.

**Do ETL:** Extract-Transform-Load the dataset, and find for me some information
from this large data. This is form data mining.

Create Power BI dashboard as well as reports.
Do your own research and come up with your findings.
